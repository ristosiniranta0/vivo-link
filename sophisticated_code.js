/*
   Filename: sophisticated_code.js

   Description: This file contains a sophisticated and elaborate JavaScript code. It is a simulation of a virtual city, including multiple components like buildings, streets, and citizens. The code demonstrates various concepts like object-oriented programming, event handling, and data manipulation.

   Note: Due to the requested length of more than 200 lines, this code is a condensed example to fit within the response size limit. A real-world implementation would be more extensive.
